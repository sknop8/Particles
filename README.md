# [Project2: Toolbox Functions](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project2-Toolbox-Functions)

See the project [here](https://sknop8.github.io/Project2-Toolbox-Functions/)!

## Overview

The objective of this project is to procedurally model and animate a bird wing.

### Built using interpolation functions, bias, and gain
* Curve of the wing (the base structure for the feathers)
* Feather spread (how feathers are spread out horizontally along the wing)
* Feather rotation (feathers change orientation depending on their position along the wing)
* Feather size (feathers change size depending on their position along the wing)
* Feather color (feathers get lighter nearer to the tip)

### Built using noise
* Wind jitter (feathers jitter slightly based on pseudo-random noise)

### Libraries used
* THREE.js
* Dat.GUI

### Interactivity
I've made the following attributes interactive for the user!
1. The curvature of the wing's basic shape
2. Feather distribution
3. Feather size
4. Feather color
5. Feather orientation
6. Flapping speed
7. Flapping motion
